run-the-test

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

Now you can run your test.  In one terminal type:

    $ RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate
    $ script/server -e test -p 3001

And in another:

    $ rake test:acceptance

If you've done everything correctly, you should eventually see:

    1 tests passed, 0 tests failed
