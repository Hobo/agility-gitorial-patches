We'll now continue and configure the available actions for all of the controllers. So far we've seen the black-list style where you list what you *don't* want:

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

auto_actions :all, :except => :index
{: .ruby}

There's also white-list style where you list what you do want, e.g.

    auto_actions :index, :show
{: .ruby}

There's also a handy shortcut to get just the read-only routes (i.e. the ones that don't modify the database)

	auto_actions :read_only
{: .ruby}
	
The opposite is handy for things that are manipulated by ajax but never viewed directly:

	auto_actions :write_only # short for -- :create, :update, :destroy
{: .ruby}

Work through your controllers and have a think about which actions you want. You need to end up with:

SHOW_PATCH

Have a play with the application with this set of actions in place. Looking pretty good!
