# Integration Testing

It's not a real application without tests.  We're going to use
[Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) to do some integration testing.

The easiest way to use selenium with rails is to use `capybara`.   We'll
also need database_cleaner because capybara/selenium does not support
transactional fixtures.

Add to your Gemfile:

    group :development, :test do
      gem 'capybara', :git => 'git://github.com/jnicklas/capybara.git'
      gem 'database_cleaner;
    end
