view-permission-based-on-project-membership

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

Note that users now have two collections of projects: `projects` are the projects that users own, and `joined_projects` are the projects they have joined as members.

We can now define view permission on projects, stories and tasks according to project membership.
