How should this effect the permissions? Certain operations on the project should probably be restricted to its owner. We'll use the `owner_is?` helper (that Hobo provides for every `belongs_to` relationship) as can save an extra DB hit:

SHOW_PATCH

One thing worth noting in the `creatable_by?` method. We assert that `owner_is? user`. This is very often found in conjunction with `:creator => true`. Together, these mean that the current user can create their own projects only, and the "Owner" form field will be automatically removed from the new project form.
