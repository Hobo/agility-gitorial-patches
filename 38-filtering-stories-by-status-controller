filtering-stories-by-status-controller

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

If you try to use the filter widget, you'll see it adds a `status` parameter in the query string. We need to pick that up and do something useful with it in the Projects controller at `app/controllers/projects_controller.rb`. Happily, we can leverage the `apply_scopes` method we earlier used in the `show` method for searching and sorting to also handle filtering by adding a `:status_is` argument:

SHOW_PATCH

Status filtering should now be working.

(To do: explain the scope being used there)
