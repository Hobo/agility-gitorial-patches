From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

The next goal for Agility is to move to a full mutli-user application, where users can create their own projects and control who has access to them. Rather than make this change in one go, we'll start with a small change that doesn't do much by itself, but is a step in the right direction: making projects be owned by users.

Add the following to the Project model:

There's a Hobo extension there: `:creator => true` tells Hobo that when creating one of these things, the `owner` association should be automatically set up to be the user doing the create.
