# Odds and ends

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

We're now going to work through some more easy but very valuable enhancements to the app. We're going to add:

 * A menu for story statuses. The free-form text field is a bit poor after all. We'll do this first with a hard-wired set of options, and then add the ability to manage the set of available statuses.

 * Add filtering of stories by status to the project page

 * Drag and drop re-ordering of tasks. This effectively gives us prioritisation of tasks.

 * Markdown or textile formatting of stories. This is implemented by changing *one symbol* in the source code.

Off we go.
