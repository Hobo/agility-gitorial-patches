Finally, now that not all projects are viewable by all users, the projects index page won't work too well. In addition, the top-level New Project page at `/projects/new` isn't suited to our purposes any more. It will fit better with Hobo's RESTful architecture to create projects for specific users, e.g. at `/users/12/projects/new`

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

So we'll modify the actions provided by the projects controller to:

SHOW_PATCH

Note that there won't be a link to that new-project page by default -- we'll add one in the next section.
