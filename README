Agility Gitorial Patchset
=========================

This is [stacked git](http://www.procode.org/stgit/) patchset for
[agility-gitorial](http://github.com/bryanlarsen/agility-gitorial/tree/master).
Since agility-gitorial constantly rewrites its history, this becomes
our real working history.

To recreate the gitorial from this patchset:

    mkdir agility-gitorial
    cd agility-gitorial
    git init
    touch README
    git add README
    git commit --cleanup=verbatim -m ""
    stg init
    stg import -i -s ../series

You'll have to issue that last command repeatedly because stg import
chokes on empty patches.

Then load the plugins:

    git submodule update --init

Start from the top of the tutorial:

    stg pop -a

View the current stage of the tutorial with

    stg show

And then switch to the next stage with

    stg push

Navigate through the tutorial by using `stg push`, `stg pop` and `stg
goto`.  Other useful commands are `stg help`, `stg series`, and `stg
edit`.

Once you have completed the gitorial, you can export any changes:

    stg export -n -epatch -d ..

Please send your changes to [me](mailto:bryan@larsen.st) so I can
update the gitorial for everybody!

More tools that were used to develop this gitorial are [available from
