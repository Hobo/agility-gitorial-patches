Agility Gitorial Patchset
=========================

This is [stacked git](http://www.procode.org/stgit/) patchset for
[agility-gitorial](http://github.com/bryanlarsen/agility-gitorial/tree/master).
Since agility-gitorial constantly rewrites its history, this becomes
our real working history.

To recreate the gitorial from this patchset:

    mkdir agility-gitorial
    cd agility-gitorial
    git init
    touch README
    git add README
    git commit --cleanup=verbatim -m ""
    stg init
    stg import -i -s ../series

You'll have to issue that last command repeatedly because stg import chokes on empty patches.

Then load the plugins:

    git submodule update --init

You can tag the gitorial using [gitorial-bulk-tag](http://github.com/bryanlarsen/gitorial-tools/tree/master)
