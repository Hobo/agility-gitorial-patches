Agility Gitorial Patchset
=========================

This is [stacked git](http://www.procode.org/stgit/) patchset for
[agility-gitorial](http://github.com/bryanlarsen/agility-gitorial/tree/master).
Since agility-gitorial constantly rewrites its history, this becomes
our real working history.

To recreate the gitorial from this patchset:

    git clone git://github.com/Hobo/agility-gitorial-patches.git
    cd agility-gitorial-patches
    mkdir agility-gitorial
    cd agility-gitorial
    git init
    touch README
    git add README
    git commit --cleanup=verbatim -m ""
    stg init
    stg import -i --reject -s ../series

Then load the plugins:

    git submodule update --init

Start from the top of the tutorial:

    stg pop -a

View the current stage of the tutorial with

    stg show

And then switch to the next stage with

    stg push

Navigate through the tutorial by using `stg push`, `stg pop` and `stg
goto`.  Other useful commands are `stg help`, `stg series`, `stg
edit` (edit the comment) and `stg refresh` (edit the commit).

Once you have completed the gitorial, you can export any changes:

    stg export -d ..

If git chokes on a commit, here's a workaround to export patch by patch:

    stg export -d .. 30-story-status-belongs-to-story.patch

Please send your changes to [me](mailto:bryan@larsen.st) so I can
update the gitorial for everybody!

More tools that were used to develop this gitorial are [available from
