# Integration Testing

It's not a real application without tests.  We're going to use [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) to do some integration testing.

We've forked selenium-on-rails to add a couple of helper functions.  Install our fork using

    $ git submodule add git://github.com/bryanlarsen/selenium-on-rails.git vendor/plugins/selenium-on-rails
