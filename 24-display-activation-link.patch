display-activation-link

From: Bryan Larsen <bryan@larsen.st>

Approximately 99% of you following this tutorial will not have set up
email correctly.  So how do you sign up?   One option is to cut and
paste out of your log files.   However, we'll be doing some
integration testing later, so we do need something a little more
convenient.  Just make sure that you revert this change before you go
to production!
